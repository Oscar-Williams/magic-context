description: Install Magic Context on OpenCode 2, move an existing OpenCode 1 install safely, and know what differs on a 2.x host.
---

Magic Context supports OpenCode 2 from version 0.43.0. A 2.x session gets the same context management, memory, session history, search, notes, and `/ctx-*` commands as on OpenCode 1. Read this page if you are installing on OpenCode 2, or upgrading an existing OpenCode 1 install to 2.x.

:::caution
Earlier releases do not work on OpenCode 2: 0.42.5 never answers on a 2.x host, and 0.42.6 refuses every turn on a data directory that ever held OpenCode 1 sessions. Use 0.43.0 or newer.
:::

## Install on OpenCode 2

Run the same setup wizard as on OpenCode 1:

```bash
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest setup
```

The wizard runs `opencode --version` to tell which OpenCode it is configuring. On OpenCode 2 it registers the plugin under the plural `plugins` key in `opencode.jsonc` and turns off built-in compaction:

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": ["@cortexkit/opencode-magic-context@latest"],
  "compaction": { "auto": false, "prune": false }
}
```

OpenCode 2 reads both the older `plugin` array and its own `plugins` array, and loads every entry in both. Setup and `doctor` check both keys, so a registration under either one is recognized and never added a second time. If you already have an entry, setup updates it under the key where it found it. Both plain strings and the `{ "package": ..., "options": ... }` object form OpenCode 2 uses are recognized. An OpenCode Desktop install with no `opencode` command on your PATH cannot be version-checked, so setup keeps the OpenCode 1 `plugin` key there.

Setup does **not** write `tui.json` on OpenCode 2. That file is read only by OpenCode 1. On 2.x the [terminal sidebar](/reference/tui-sidebar/) loads from the plugin entry itself.

The shared `magic-context.jsonc` is the same file on every harness; see [Installation](/getting-started/installation/) for its locations and the historian model setting.

If you add the entry by hand, use `plugins` on 2.x. Do not list Magic Context under both keys: OpenCode loads the first entry and fails the second with "Duplicate plugin ID", so the plugins list shows two rows, one of them failed. `opencode plugin add` can create exactly this when an entry already sits under `plugin`. `npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --fix` keeps one entry and removes the rest.

## Updating Magic Context on OpenCode 2

OpenCode 2 installs an `@latest` plugin once and keeps loading that copy. When a new release is published, OpenCode only marks the plugin "update available" in `/plugins`; it does not install it. Pressing ctrl+r there refreshes that mark, but installs nothing.

To install the new release, do one of these:

- Open `/plugins` and press ctrl+u. OpenCode installs the new version and reloads the plugin without a restart.
- Run `opencode plugin update`.
- Quit OpenCode (including `opencode service stop`) and run `npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --fix`. Doctor removes the outdated cached copy, and OpenCode installs the current release on its next start. Doctor won't remove it while OpenCode is running.

An entry pinned to a version, such as `@cortexkit/opencode-magic-context@0.42.6`, never moves. Change it to `@latest`, or run `doctor --force` to do that for you.

## Move an existing OpenCode 1 install

The first time OpenCode 2 opens an OpenCode 1 data directory, it converts `opencode.db` in place. Do one step **before** you upgrade OpenCode:

1. Stop every OpenCode process.
2. Run the doctor with `--fix`:

   ```bash
   npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --fix
   ```

3. Upgrade OpenCode to 2.x and start it.

### Why this step matters

OpenCode 2 drops an OpenCode 1 compaction record whose summary has no completion time. Magic Context's compaction markers from earlier releases did not carry that time. If such a marker is dropped during conversion, a long session loads its entire history instead of the summarized part. That can use extreme memory and CPU, and the session may never reach Magic Context at all.

`doctor --fix` adds the missing completion time to Magic Context's own markers. It never touches summaries OpenCode wrote itself. Markers written by current versions already carry the time.

### If OpenCode 2 already converted the store

Run `doctor` (without `--fix`). If it reports that Magic Context markers are missing from the converted store, ask OpenCode 2 to convert again:

1. Stop every OpenCode process.
2. Open the database path `doctor` prints in `sqlite3` and clear only the conversion marker:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM kv WHERE key = 'migration.v1-v2';
   ```

3. Start the server by hand on any free port, not with `opencode service start` (see [the note below](#a-first-start-can-be-killed-mid-conversion)):

   ```bash
   opencode serve --port 4096
   ```

4. Leave it running until this query returns `{"phase":"completed"}`:

   ```sql
   SELECT value FROM kv WHERE key = 'migration.v1-v2';
   ```

Do not edit the `session_v2` or `session_message` tables directly.

## What converts, and what converts back

OpenCode 2 keeps the OpenCode 1 tables next to its own. That is what lets you downgrade OpenCode later.

The conversion renumbers messages. It splits some content into rows of its own and merges completed compaction pairs into one record. Magic Context saves positions in that message list: where each [compartment](/concepts/historian/) starts and ends, note anchors, the search index, and the protected tail. On the first turn of each session after a conversion, Magic Context re-derives all of those positions from the ids of messages that still exist, in one step.

A downgrade to OpenCode 1 does the same thing in reverse. Each session pays **one prompt-cache rebuild per direction**: one after the upgrade, one after a downgrade.

A few things can come out of the conversion slightly different:

- **A compartment whose first or last message no longer exists is marked unresolved.** It still appears in the agent's session history and is still readable by id. `ctx_expand` refuses to expand its message range, because that range can no longer be trusted. The next conversion in either direction checks it again.
- **A queued `ctx_reduce` drop that would now cover more than it originally did is discarded** and reported, not applied.
- `doctor` lists sessions still waiting for this step and the number of unresolved compartments in each session.

Fresh OpenCode 2 sessions, Pi sessions, and project memory are not affected.

If you downgrade OpenCode, keep Magic Context on the current version. Older Magic Context releases refuse the upgraded database; see [Storage unavailable / schema fence error](/help/troubleshooting/#storage-unavailable--schema-fence-error).

## Known limits on OpenCode 2

These come from what the OpenCode 2 host lets a plugin do.

### Echoed tags can show in the transcript

Magic Context marks each item the agent sees with a `§N§` tag. Models sometimes echo a tag at the start of a reply. OpenCode 1 lets Magic Context strip that echo once the reply finishes, before it is saved. OpenCode 2 has no hook after a reply finishes, so the echo is saved and shown as the model wrote it. Weaker models do this more often.

What the model receives is unchanged: the next request strips and re-tags the echo exactly as on OpenCode 1. Only the transcript view differs.

### A first start can be killed mid-conversion

Converting a large store can take several minutes. `opencode service start` may decide the server is unresponsive during that time and kill it. For the first start after upgrading a large install, run the server by hand and leave it until conversion finishes:

```bash
opencode serve --port 4096
```

Conversion is finished when `SELECT value FROM kv WHERE key = 'migration.v1-v2';` returns `{"phase":"completed"}`. After that, start OpenCode the usual way.

### The historian runs single-shot

On OpenCode 2 each [historian](/concepts/historian/) run is one request with no tool calls. It runs on the historian's configured model, in a hidden session.

The [dreamer](/concepts/dreamer/) also runs tool-loop tasks on OpenCode 2: `map-memories`, `verify`, `verify-broad`, `curate`, `retrospective`, `maintain-docs`, and `refresh-primers`. Each uses a task-scoped hidden agent with only its permitted tools. Single-shot and host-only tasks continue to run as before.

### Hidden sessions appear as top-level sessions

OpenCode 2 gives plugins no way to attach a session to a parent. Magic Context keeps reusable hidden sessions for single-shot tasks. A tool-loop task gets a fresh hidden session for each run, so its tool history cannot leak into the next run. They are titled `Magic Context historian` and `Magic Context dreamer`.

A session is retired when a run in it fails or is interrupted, or when a new OpenCode version replaces it.

With [`keep_subagents: true`](/reference/configuration/), retired sessions are kept by the same rule as OpenCode 1. A session that ever completed a run is kept for either role, whatever its latest run did, because it holds those earlier runs. A historian session is always kept. Only a dreamer session none of whose runs ever completed is deleted. Kept sessions stay marked as hidden, and turning the option off lets the next start delete them.

Otherwise Magic Context deletes a retired session through OpenCode's own session API. That works only when the host registered itself as a service, as `opencode serve --service` does. A plain `opencode serve` or a `--standalone` host registers no service. There, retired sessions are kept and retried by a later process, and Magic Context reports the limitation `MC-H02`. To list them:

```bash
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor list-hidden-sessions
```

### Other differences

- **Command output** from the `/ctx-*` commands appears only in a connected terminal UI. The commands themselves run from any client.
- **The sidebar is hidden by default.** Toggle it with `ctrl+x b`.
- **`transform_mode: "rust"` is not available.** Magic Context runs the TypeScript transform instead, logs one warning, and shows `MC-S06` in `/ctx-status`.

## Where logs live

On OpenCode 2, Magic Context writes its log to a separate directory from OpenCode 1, under your system temp directory:

```text
$TMPDIR/opencode2/magic-context/magic-context.log
```

OpenCode 1 writes to `$TMPDIR/opencode/magic-context/magic-context.log`. On Linux, `$TMPDIR` is usually `/tmp`. Set `MAGIC_CONTEXT_LOG_PATH` to write the log somewhere else.

When Magic Context refuses a turn before it reaches the provider, the reason and session are written to this log. Include the log when you [file a bug report](/help/troubleshooting/#filing-a-bug-report).
